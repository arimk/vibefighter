- Fish Audio for name audio generation

Database is based on Supabase and file storage with CloudFlare R2

Use exemple.env to populate your different keys and options. 

Music were generated with Suno and sounds with elevenLabs

## Known issues & best practices

- It's just a concept so many issues can be found
- When creating a character, the best 3D output would be a full front facing character with hands and legs not too close to the body or to each other
- AI fighter is not the best
- Animations are threeJS hand made so not the best
- No control on special attacks meaning some can be badly drawn
